The extras folder will contain most of stuffs helping the learning processes about virtual Mac as popularised by Foxlet starting
from G Somlo impulsion.

      In particular I shall take definitely a non conformist way to this learning ,for example I shall not
      only explain what I understand from the foxletfox's repo ,by giving unusual example of using it ,but 
      also I shall emphasize on examples of how one can do things differently from what everybody sees when
      googling around ....and of course even beyond kvm virtual mac .

      Ex :  How can one install hackintosh without using a usb stick ?  
      ( which is almost 100% cases advised on the net !!)
            
            Build an mac installer directly from linux (using simply live ubuntu) so as to install your 
            virtual mac without internet
            
  Just to name a few .The extras folder will be slowly filled up with time
